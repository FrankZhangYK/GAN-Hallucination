# GAN-Hallucination
This projects investigates the possible hallucinations or adversarial attacks for solving linear inverse problems. The goal is to understand the possible hallucinations, define metrics to quantify the hallucination, and find regularization techniques to make deep reconstruction nets robust against hallucination.
